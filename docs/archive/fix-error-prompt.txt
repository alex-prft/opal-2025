TRy a different approach to solve the issue and make the correct updates for me.

Please conduct a thorough and critical code review of the following changes. The primary objectives are to fix the above errors and issues:

Prevent Recurrence of Specific Past Errors: We have encountered the following critical issues in past deployments

Please pay close attention to any code that might reintroduce these issues or exhibit similar anti-patterns.
Ensure Complete Functionality and Correctness: Verify the code meets all functional requirements and produces the expected output under various conditions, including edge cases and potential failure scenarios.

Guarantee Deployment Readiness: Confirm the code is robust, maintainable, and ready for a production deployment. This includes checking for proper error handling, logging, test coverage, performance issues, and adherence to our team's coding standards. 

Focus Areas Checklist:

Error Handling: Are all potential errors, especially those related to the past issues mentioned above, caught and handled gracefully? Is there sufficient logging to aid debugging in a production environment?
Logic and Edge Cases: Does the logic cover all possible scenarios and edge cases? Are there any unhandled conditions or potential logical flaws?

Testing: Is the code adequately covered by unit and integration tests? Do the tests cover the common success paths and the most common error scenarios?

Readability and Maintainability: Is the code clean, well-structured, and easy to understand for future developers? Does it adhere to our naming conventions and style guides?

Code Duplication: Are there opportunities to simplify or refactor the code to remove duplication and improve modularity? 

Implement these changes to ensure these errors and requests are permanently resolved.

add this repeatable process to a series of unit tests in /tests/unit for this error
