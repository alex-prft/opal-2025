Provide comprehensive, current-state performance metrics.\\n\\n**Data Sources:**\\n- Content Recommendations (Content Recs): [[content_topics]], [[top_content]], [[user_interactions]]\\n- Optimizely Data Platform (ODP): [[persona_data]] (aggregated, no PII)\\n- Analytics Data: [[analytics_data]]\\n\\n**Page Purpose:**\\nThis view shows how recommended content is performing **right now** across topics, individual content assets, and personas, using data from Content Recs and ODP.\\n\\nThis page should help answer:\\n- Which topics are actually working?\\n- Which content assets are doing the heavy lifting?\\n- Which personas are getting the most value from our content?\\n\\n**Analysis Framework:**\\n\\n1. **HERO/OVERVIEW STRIP (TOP OF PAGE)**\\n   - Generate 1-sentence summary: \\\"How your recommended content is performing across topics, assets, and personas.\\\"\\n   - Calculate 2-3 key high-level numbers from Content Recs (NO CURRENCY):\\n     * Total interactions with recommended content (last 30 days)\\n     * Total unique visitors who engaged with recommended content\\n     * Count of topics with meaningful activity (interactions above minimum threshold)\\n\\n2. **TOPIC PERFORMANCE (BY INTERACTIONS & VOLUME)**\\n   - Build table/chart using Content Recs data\\n   - For each topic: topic_name, interactions, unique_visitors, share_of_interactions\\n   - Default sort: descending by interactions\\n   - Column labels: \\\"Interactions\\\", \\\"Unique visitors\\\", \\\"Share of interactions\\\"\\n   - Add performance indicators based on interactions vs uniques ratios\\n\\n3. **TOP CONTENT BY TOPIC**\\n   - Show actual content assets driving the numbers\\n   - For each content item: content_title, content_type, associated_topic, interactions, unique_visitors\\n   - Default sort: descending by interactions\\n   - Group/associate assets under their primary topic\\n   - Calculate share_of_topic_interactions for each asset\\n\\n4. **TOP CONTENT BY PERSONA**\\n   - Use ODP + Content Recs via aggregated data (NO PII)\\n   - Assume 4 personas defined in OPAL/ODP instructions\\n   - For each persona: persona_name, list of top 3-5 content items\\n   - Content items: content_title, topic, interactions_from_known_users\\n   - Brief explanation: \\\"Shows which recommended content is most consumed by known users in each persona, based on ODP profiles.\\\"\\n\\n5. **DATA NOTES & LINEAGE**\\n   - Topic and content metrics come from Content Recommendations logs\\n   - Persona views come from ODP aggregation (no PII shown)\\n   - Data window: Last 30 days, last updated time\\n   - If data incomplete: label clearly but don't block the page\\n\\n**Performance Metrics to Calculate:**\\n- Total interactions with recommended content\\n- Total unique visitors engaged\\n- Number of topics with meaningful activity\\n- Topic performance distribution\\n- Content asset performance rankings\\n- Persona-specific consumption patterns\\n\\n**Content Requirements:**\\n- DESCRIPTIVE CURRENT-STATE ONLY - no strategic recommendations\\n- NO revenue, currency, or dollar amounts anywhere\\n- Use business-friendly language: \\\"Impact\\\", \\\"Optimization\\\", \\\"Performance\\\"\\n- Avoid: heavy jargon, \\\"synergy\\\", \\\"leverage\\\" as verb, vague phrases\\n- Section labels: Overview, Topic Performance, Top Content by Topic, Top Content by Persona, Data Notes\\n\\n**Output Format:**\\n\\n**HERO SUMMARY**\\n[1-sentence description of content performance across topics, assets, and personas]\\n\\n**KEY METRICS**\\n- Total Interactions: [number] (interactions with recommended content, last 30 days)\\n- Unique Visitors: [number] (users who engaged with recommended content)\\n- Active Topics: [number] (topics with meaningful activity above threshold)\\n\\n**TOPIC PERFORMANCE**\\n[Table format:]\\nTopic | Interactions | Unique Visitors | Share of Interactions\\n1. [Topic Name] | [number] | [number] | [percentage]%\\n2. [Topic Name] | [number] | [number] | [percentage]%\\n\\n**TOP CONTENT BY TOPIC**\\n[Grouped by topic, sorted by interactions DESC:]\\nTopic: [Name]\\n- [Content Title] ([Type]) | [interactions] interactions | [uniques] unique visitors\\n- [Content Title] ([Type]) | [interactions] interactions | [uniques] unique visitors\\n\\n**TOP CONTENT BY PERSONA**\\n[For each persona:]\\nPersona: [Name]\\n- [Content Title] (Topic: [topic]) | [interactions] from known users\\n- [Content Title] (Topic: [topic]) | [interactions] from known users\\n\\n**DATA NOTES**\\n- Topic and content metrics from Content Recommendations logs\\n- Persona data from ODP aggregation (no PII shown)\\n- Data window: Last 30 days, updated [timestamp]\\n- [Any data limitations or notes]\\n\\n***CRITICAL GUARDRAILS:***\\n- NO revenue, currency, or financial metrics\\n- Current-state descriptive analysis only\\n- Clear, consistent section labeling\\n- Never block page for missing data - show what's available with notes",
