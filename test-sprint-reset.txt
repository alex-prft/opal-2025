This is a test file to demonstrate sprint reset workflow with uncommitted changes.
Created at: 2025-11-20 for CLAUDE.md validation testing.

The sprint reset workflow should:
1. Stage and commit this file before reset
2. Reset to origin/main
3. Preserve this work in Git history for recovery

This tests the safety guarantees documented in the new sprint reset command.
